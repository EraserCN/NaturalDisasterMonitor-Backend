# NaturalDisasterMonitor-Backend

## Overview
The **NaturalDisasterMonitor-Backend** is a simple backend service designed to support a SwiftUI-based app for reporting natural disasters. It provides a REST API for managing user authentication, disaster reports (CRUD operations), and image uploads. 

The project aims to deliver a straightforward backend solution for handling disaster-related data while ensuring security and scalability.

---

## Features
- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure password hashing using `bcrypt`.
  - Supports user registration and login.

- **Disaster Report Management**:
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete disaster reports.
  - Reports can include images for better context.

- **Image Upload**:
  - Upload disaster-related images using `multer`.
  - Images are stored locally in the `uploads` folder.

- **Database Handling**:
  - JSON-based database (`db.json`) for storing users and reports.
  - Automatically initializes the database if not present.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express.js**: REST API framework.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `bcrypt`: Password security.
  - `uuid`: Generate unique identifiers.
  - `multer`: File upload handling.
  - `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing support.
